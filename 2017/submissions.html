	  <h3>2. Paper Submission</h3>

	  <div class="text">
	    <p>Submissions that address research and development, as
	      well as experience reports and tool demonstrations on
	      the above and other related topics are strongly
	      encouraged. Papers can be submitted as full papers,
	      short papers and posters. Each submitted symposium paper
	      will be peer-reviewed by at least three International
	      Program Committee members. All accepted papers and
	      posters will appear in the proceedings of
	      VINCI 2017 published by ACM Press and made
	      available in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org"
	      target="_blank">ACM Digital Library</a> (EI
	      indexed). Moreover, authors of a number of selected full
	      papers of high quality will be invited to prepare
	      revised versions of their work for submission to a
	      special issue of
	      the <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-visual-languages-and-computing/"
	      target="_blank">Journal of Visual Languages and
	      Computing</a> (Elsevier; SCI indexed). In addition, it
	      is planned that revised versions of selected best papers
	      in art and design will be invited for the subsequent
	      publication in a special issue
	      of <a href="http://www.leonardo.info/leoinfo.html"
	      target="_blank">Leonardo</a> (MIT Press; AHCI
	      indexed).</p>
	  
	    <p>Research papers and experience reports of up
	      to <b>eight (8)</b>, short papers of up to <b>four
	      (4)</b>, and tool demonstrations or posters of up
	      to <b>two (2)</b> ACM double-column pages should be
	      submitted
	      through <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vinci2017"
	      target="_blank">easychair.org</a>. The review process
	      will be single-blind. We appreciate the submission of
	      videos or other supplemental material. Please provide a
	      URL at the end of the submitted paper to enable the
	      reviewers the download of your additional
	      material. Detailed information on the electronic
	      submission can be found at the end of this page.</p>
	  </div>

	  
	  <h3>3. Workshops and Tutorials</h3>

	  <div class="text">
	    <p>VINCI'17 is also soliciting proposals for full-day or
	      half-day workshops and tutorials on topics that address
	      areas of interest to the community. Proposals should not
	      be longer than a maximum of 2 pages. In
	      particular, <em>workshop proposals</em> should
	      include:</p>

	    <div class="items">
	      <ul>
		<li>The title and a brief description of the specific
		issues that the workshop will address, the reasons why
		the workshop is of interest in these times, and the
		main research areas involved.</li>

		<li>Contact information of the workshop chairs, their
		competence in the proposed topic(s) and previous
		experience in chairing scientific events.</li>

		<li>A tentative list of program committee
		members.</li>

		<li>Intended length (half or full day) and a draft of
		the Call for Papers.</li>

		<li>It is expected that the workshop organizers will
		setup an own workshop web page as soon as the workshop
		proposal has been accepted.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </div>

	    <p>Tutorials usually attract a broad range of audiences,
	      including professionals, researchers, students, or
	      practitioners, who wish to enhance their knowledge in
	      the specific tutorial topic. Tutorials offer a unique
	      opportunity to disseminate in-depth information on
	      specific topics in visual information communication and
	      interaction. <em>Tutorial proposals</em> should include
	      short biographies of the proposers, a draft of the
	      tutorial content, intended length, and evidence of the
	      possibility of attracting audience to the tutorial.</p>

	    <p>It is possible to extend the symposium by one day in
	      case many workshops or tutorials are proposed and
	      accepted. Detailed information on the submission of
	      workshop and tutorial proposals can be found at the end
	      of this page.</p>
	  </div>

	  
	  <h3>4. Special Sessions and Panels</h3>

	  <div class="text">
	    <p>We also invite <em>special session and panel
	      proposals</em> for VINCI'17.  Proposals for special
	      sessions and panels should include the title, aim and
	      scope, the names and affiliations of the organizers
	      together with a short biography.  Including a list of
	      potential contributors or panel members would be
	      helpful.  The proposers are expected to have a good
	      publication track record and excellent standing in the
	      proposed area. Detailed information on the submission of
	      special sessions and panel proposals can be found at the
	      end of this page.</p>
	    
	    <p>Papers for special sessions should be submitted through
	      the VINCI'17 EasyChair submission system. The paper
	      types are identical to those of regular submissions. It
	      is the responsibility of the special session organizers
	      to make sure that papers submitted to their special
	      session clearly indicate the name of the special session
	      the paper belongs to. All papers submitted to special
	      sessions will be subject to the same peer-review
	      procedure as regular papers (however chaired by the
	      special session organizers) and will appear in the
	      VINCI'17 symposium proceedings as well. The symposium
	      chairs reserve the right to move accepted papers for a
	      special session into a regular session in case the
	      special session has finally less than four papers. In
	      this case, the special session will be cancelled.</p>
