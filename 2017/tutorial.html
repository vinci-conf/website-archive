	    <p><strong>Prof. Alfred Inselberg, Tel Aviv University,
	      Senior Fellow San Diego Supercomputing
	      Center</strong></p>

	    <h4>Abstract</h4>

	    <p>A dataset with <em>M</em> items has
	      2<sup><em>M</em></sup> subsets, any one of which may be
	      the one satisfying our objective. With a good data
	      display and interactivity our fantastic
	      pattern-recognition defeats this combinatorial explosion
	      by extracting insights from the visual patterns. This is
	      the core reason for data visualization. With parallel
	      coordinates the search for relations in multivariate
	      data is transformed into a 2-D pattern recognition
	      problem. Together with criteria for good query design,
	      we illustrate this on several real datasets (financial,
	      process control, credit-score, one with hundreds of
	      variables) with stunning results. A geometric
	      classification algorithm yields the classification rule
	      explicitly and visually. The minimal set of variables,
	      features, are found and ordered by their predictive
	      value. A model of a country's economy reveals
	      sensitivities, impact of constraints, trade-offs and
	      economic sectors unknowingly competing for the same
	      resources. An overview of the methodology provides
	      foundational understanding; learning the patterns
	      corresponding to various multivariate relations. These
	      patterns are robust in the presence of errors and that
	      is good news for the applications. A topology of
	      proximity emerges opening the way for visualization in
	      Big Data.</p>

	    <p>The tutorial will include an interactive data
	    exploration session, for which participants can bring
	    along their own multidimensional datasets. Datasets should
	    be in Excel format and with all-numeric values (at most 4
	    significant digits, values of categorical data can be
	    listed as integers), and max. 5MB in size. Five files will
	    be explored in real-time during the third hour of the
	    tutorial to demo and teach the basic skills (if more than
	    five files are submitted, five will be chosen by
	    lottery).</p>


	    <h4>Short Bio</h4>

	    <img align="left" alt="Alfred Inselberg" hspace="10"
		 src="images/tutorial/AI.jpg" width="220">

	    <p>Alfred Inselberg received a Ph.D. in Mathematics and
	      Physics from the University of Illinois (UICU). He was
	      at the Biological Computer Lab (BCL), doing research on
	      Brain Function, Cognition and Neural Networks (together
	      the McCulloch Lab at MIT). He stayed on as Professor and
	      subsequently was IBM researcher (at the Los Angeles
	      Scientific Center and later Yorktown Labs). There he
	      developed a Mathematical Model of the Ear (TIME,
	      Newsweek 1974 etc) concurrently teaching at UCLA and
	      USC. He also held academic positions at the Technion,
	      Ben Gurion University and Tel Aviv University since
	      1995. Inselberg was elected Senior Fellow in
	      Visualization at the San Diego Supercomputing Center
	      (1996), Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Korea
	      University (2008) and National University of Singapore
	      (2011). He invented the multidimensional visualization
	      methodology of Parallel Coordinates which became widely
	      applied (Air Traffic Control, Data Mining etc) receiving
	      numerous patents and awards. His textbook was published
	      by Springer and praised by Stephen Hawking, among
	      others.</p>
