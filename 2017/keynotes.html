	      Inconsistencies<br> Prof. Du ZHANG<br> (Macau University
	      of Science and Technology)</strong></p>

	    <h4>Abstract</h4>

	    <p>Perpetual learning, also known as continuous,
	      life-long, or never-ending learning, is an active
	      research direction in machine learning. It is concerned
	      with how to develop computing systems that can
	      automatically, consistently and continuously improve
	      their performance at tasks over time. Specifically, a
	      perpetual learning agent, a long-lived problem-solving
	      system whose knowledge could be of visualized forms, can
	      be defined through its STEP dimensions.</p>

	    <p>Given <em>S</em> as a set of learning
	      stimuli, <em>T</em> as a set of tasks, <em>E</em> as
	      type of experience, and <em>P</em> as performance
	      metric, a computing system perpetually learns with
	      regard to (<em>S, T, E, P</em>) if the system
	      automatically, consistently and continuously improves
	      its performance <em>P</em> at <em>T</em>,
	      following <em>S</em> and <em>E</em> over time.</p>
	    
	    <p>There are many types of learning stimuli. In this talk,
	      we focus on treating inconsistent phenomena
	      (uncertainties, anomalies, surprises, conflicts,
	      outliers or peculiarities that manifest themselves at
	      various granularities of knowledge content) as learning
	      stimuli, and adopting inconsistency-specific learning
	      algorithms to refine and/or augment existing
	      problem-solving knowledge through overcoming
	      (explaining, or circumventing) the
	      inconsistencies. Inconsistencies can serve as effective
	      stimuli to learning because they often signify the
	      inadequacies, gaps, deficiencies, or uncovered boundary
	      conditions in an agent's (visualized) knowledge.</p>

	    <p>We describe an inconsistency-induced learning framework
	      called i<sup>2</sup>Learning for such perpetual learning
	      agents whose life span is an alternating and open-ended
	      sequence of task-performing episodes and learning
	      episodes. Each learning episode is triggered by an
	      inconsistent stimulus, and learning is essentially
	      embodied in an agent's capability to find ways to
	      overcome inconsistent phenomena stemming from deficient
	      (visualized) knowledge. Through refining its
	      problem-solving knowledge, each learning episode leads
	      to an improved problem-solving performance <em>P</em>
	      for subsequent task-performing episodes.</p>

	    <p>Du Zhang is Professor and Dean of the Faculty of
	      Information Technology, Macau University of Science and
	      Technology, Macau, China. He received his Ph.D. and
	      M.S. degrees, both in computer science, from the
	      University of Illinois and Nanjing University, China,
	      respectively. Previously he was a Professor and Chair of
	      the Computer Science Department at California State
	      University, Sacramento. He has research affiliations
	      with numerous universities in the USA, UK, Hong Kong,
	      China, Czech Republic, and Mexico.</p>

	    <p>Professor Zhang's current research interests include
	      machine learning (inconsistency-induced perpetual
	      learning), knowledge-based systems, big data analytics,
	      and software engineering. He has over 200 publications
	      in these and other areas. He has served in various roles
	      on numerous international conferences, and is editor or
	      editorial board member for several journals in the areas
	      of artificial intelligence, software engineering and
	      knowledge engineering, big data, and applied
	      mathematics. Professor Zhang is a senior member of both
	      the IEEE and ACM, a board member of the Society of
	      Information Reuse and Integration, and a member of
	      Upsilon Pi Epsilon and Phi Beta Delta.</p>

	    <h4>Abstract</h4>

	    <p>The anticipated future of infoviz displays is broadly
	      surveyed.  Multimodal displays&mdash;including
	      multimedia animation, sonification with spatial audio,
	      microtypography, panoramic and omnidirectional displays,
	      and stereography&mdash;represent enticing ways to extend
	      infoviz into next-generation interfaces.  The emergence
	      of ubicomp (ubiquitous computing), IoT (internet of
	      things), VR (virtual reality) & AR (augmented reality)
	      paradigms, including mobile-ambient interfaces
	      integrating personal control and locative resources,
	      offer new options for ambient displays.  HMDs
	      (head-mounted displays), speaker arrays, roomware, and
	      lighting can be exploited by opportunistic systems to
	      maximize information bandwidth, scientific insight, and
	      experiential satisfaction.  Room-sized immersive
	      interfaces were described by author and scientist Isaac
	      Asimov 50 years ago as the "Prime Radiant" in his
	      science fiction "Foundation” series.  Asimov’s inspired
	      vision is recapitulated, and shown to be increasingly
	      applicable to contemporary capabilities.  This keynote
	      address features live demonstrations, including embedded
	      animation, spatial sound, mobile interfaces, and
	      chromastereopsis.</p>
