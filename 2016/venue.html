We have negotiated a very competitive room rate at $69+tax (single king) and $74+tax (double queen) per night including a continental breakfast for VINCI&#39;2016 delegates. To secure these rates, you must reserve your room by 2 September 2016 by quoting &quot;VINCI 2016&quot; when you book your room to ensure this rate. The hotel is recently renovated and clean. We do not recommend other nearby hotels, since they are either of low quality, or not in walking distance and far more expensive.<br />
