<h3>2. Paper Submission</h3>

<div class="text">
	<p>Submissions that address research and development, as well as experience reports and tool demonstrations on the above and other related topics are strongly encouraged. Papers can be submitted as full papers, short papers and posters. Each submitted symposium paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three International Program Committee members. You are welcome to submit a paper to VINCI 2019. All accepted papers and posters will appear in the proceedings of VINCI 2019 published by ACM Press and made available in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org" target="_blank">ACM Digital Library</a> (EI indexed). Moreover, authors of a number of selected full papers of high quality will be invited to prepare revised versions of their work for submission to the <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-visual-languages-and-computing/" target="_blank">Journal of Visual Languages and Computing</a> (JVLC, SCI indexed) and a special issue of the <a href="https://vciba.springeropen.com/" target="_blank">Journal of Visual Computing for Industry, Biomedicine, and Art</a>, and a special issue of the  <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/12650" target="_blank">Journal of Visualization</a> (SCI indexed). </p>

<p>Research papers and experience reports of up to <b>eight (8)</b>, short papers of up to <b>four (4)</b>, and tool demonstrations or posters of up to <b>two (2)</b> ACM double-column pages should be submitted through <a hname="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vinci2019" target="_blank">easychair.org</a>. The review process will be single-blind. We appreciate the submission of videos or other supplemental material. Please provide a URL at the end of the submitted paper to enable the reviewers the download of your additional material. Detailed information on the electronic submission can be found at the end of this page.</p>
</div>

<h3>3. Workshops and Tutorials</h3>

<div class="text">
<p>VINCI &#39;19 is also soliciting proposals for full-day or half-day workshops and tutorials on topics that address areas of interest to the community. Proposals should not be longer than a maximum of 2 pages. In particular, <em>workshop proposals</em> should include:</p>

<div class="items">
<ul>
	<li>The title and a brief description of the specific issues that the workshop will address, the reasons why the workshop is of interest in these times, and the main research areas involved.</li>
	<li>Contact information of the workshop chairs, their competence in the proposed topic(s) and previous experience in chairing scientific events.</li>
	<li>A tentative list of program committee members.</li>
	<li>Intended length (half or full day) and a draft of the Call for Papers.</li>
	<li>It is expected that the workshop organizers will setup an own workshop web page as soon as the workshop proposal has been accepted.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Tutorials usually attract a broad range of audiences, including professionals, researchers, students, or practitioners, who wish to enhance their knowledge in the specific tutorial topic. Tutorials offer a unique opportunity to disseminate in-depth information on specific topics in visual information communication and interaction. <em>Tutorial proposals</em> should include short biographies of the proposers, a draft of the tutorial content, intended length, and evidence of the possibility of attracting audience to the tutorial.</p>

<p>It is possible to extend the symposium by one day in case many workshops or tutorials are proposed and accepted. Detailed information on the submission of workshop and tutorial proposals can be found at the end of this page.</p>
</div>

<h3>4. Special Sessions and Panels</h3>

<div class="text">
<!--<p>We also invite <em>special session and panel proposals</em> for VINCI &#39;19. Proposals for special sessions and panels should include the title, aim and scope, the names and affiliations of the organizers together with a short biography. Including a list of potential contributors or panel members would be helpful. The proposers are expected to have a good publication track record and excellent standing in the proposed area. Detailed information on the submission of special sessions and panel proposals can be found at the end of this page.</p>-->

<!--<p>Papers for special sessions should be submitted through the VINCI &#39;19 EasyChair submission system. The paper types are identical to those of regular submissions. It is the responsibility of the special session organizers to make sure that papers submitted to their special session clearly indicate the name of the special session the paper belongs to. All papers submitted to special sessions will be subject to the same peer-review procedure as regular papers (however chaired by the special session organizers) and will appear in the VINCI &#39;19 symposium proceedings as well. The symposium chairs reserve the right to move accepted papers for a special session into a regular session in case the special session has finally less than four papers. In this case, the special session will be cancelled.</p>-->
