		<strong><a href="https://www.stephenzhangart.com">Prof. Stephen Zhang</a><br />
		(University of North Texas, US)</strong></p>

	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	Storytelling is one of the most basic and effective means of human communication. It creates context thus deepens the understanding of abstract concepts. Storytelling generates empathy, provokes emotions, and triggers actions. In this presentation, the speaker will discuss the increasing impact of storytelling in today’s communication design and brand building. He will discuss different approaches to storytelling and explore their process, ideation and strategy in visual communication. He will present case-studies from his diverse professional experience and discuss how social media has affected storytelling today.

	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	Many visualization studies aim to make the best visualization picture which represents the most essential knowledge as much as possible, while other studies develop richer interactions to discover surprising knowledge freely. Richer interactions may bring a higher possibility of knowledge discovery; however, often it requires expert-level experiences and time-consuming processes. We expect more straightforward interactions for visualization tasks will bring a lot of discoveries time-consuming processes. This talk introduces various visualization studies of our teams which aim to explore data with simpler interactions. Our studies presented in this talk include dimension selection for multi-dimensional data visualization and guided immersive visualization for ocean simulation/measurement data and location-embedded social media data.

	<h4>Short Bio</h4>
	Takayuki Itoh is a professor at the Department of Information Sciences, Ochanomizu University. Born in Tokyo, He received B.S. degree and M.S. degree and Ph.D. degree from Waseda University. He was a researcher at IBM Japan, Tokyo Research Laboratory (Until 2005/April). Upon graduation, He was once a Visiting Researcher at Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University. Later, He was a COE Researcher (corresponding to a Visiting Associate Professor) at Kyoto University. After that, he became an Associate Professor at Department of Information Sciences, Ochanomizu University. In addition, he was a Visiting Researcher at University of California at Davis in 2008 and the University of Sydney in 2014.

	<p><img align="right" alt="Bo GAO" hspace="10" src="images/keynotes/Bo GAO.png" width="150" /> <strong>Design for Good</strong><br />– Personalized Visual Communication for Medical Interactions<br />
		<strong><a href="http://tjdi.tongji.edu.cn/TeacherDetail.do?id=138&lang=_en">Prof. Bo GAO</a><br />
			(Tongji University, Shanghai)</strong></p>

	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	Although the medical information is commonly delivered based on testing report, laboratory data, x-rays imagery, and then later technologies such as CT scans and MRIs, the interactions are still far from good experience, which comprise multiple layers of processes and handoffs, constantly create redundant data and lead to communication angst.<br /><br />
	My recent research is focusing on the personalized visual communication design that could comfortably improve the presentation and interaction of the medical information with non-professionals. Most medical information systems are one-way designed for professional staff, using structured and rigid analytical diagrams and graphics to interpret complex information. This talk introduces our studies aiming to develop the portable visualized communication approach for non-professionals that doesn’t require expert-level experiences to understand the various health indicators, anomalies highlights, and treatment context.<br /><br />
	The beauty of the visualized medical interaction requires not just the capabilities of latest technology, but also personalized humanistic care and mental cognition on top of the scientific information presentation. Our studies selected data from certain clinical communications and operational processes to design immersed environment adaptation, interactive process guidance, cross-therapeutic capabilities and trackable psychological restoration, in order to ensure the medical services are safe, confident, efficient and most of all patient-centered.

	<h4>Short Bio</h4>
	Bo GAO is the associate professor at the College of Design and Innovation, Tongji University. Her research interests include extensive social innovation topics such as urbanization and population aging, medical and well-being communications, and community renovation, etc. She is an active speaker in the conference of service science & design, and information & communication design. Ms. GAO was a visiting scholar at Rochester Institute of Technology in 2013, visiting lecture at University of Lapland doctoral programme in 2017 and senior visiting scholar at Dentsu Inc. in 2019. Ms. Gao received her PhD degree from Tongji University, and held membership of DRS, DMI, DESIS, LeNS, and Shanghai Designers Association.
