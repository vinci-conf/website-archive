<h3 id="workshop1">Workshop on Eye Tracking and Visual Communication (ETVC)</h3>
<p>
    Eye tracking is a powerful technology to record people's eye movement behavior while they solve a certain task. For example, watching a video, reading or implementing source code, interacting with a user interface, walking in a 3D scene, using VR technologies, or just understanding a static diagram.
</p>

<p>
Although lots of eye tracking experiments have been conducted over the years, it still remains challenging to analyze the recorded spatio-temporal data for common patterns, in particular, if the goal is to explore the common visual communication that is important to improve the provided stimuli, being them static, dynamic, interactive, 2D, or 3D.
</p>

<p>
In this workshop on "Eye Tracking and Visual Communication (ETVC)" we focus on applying eye tracking techniques and eye movement data exploration strategies in order to improve the visual communication between people with and without visual stimuli.
</p>

<h4>The relevant topics for this workshop are:</h4>
<div class="items-twocol">
<ul>
	<li>Eye tracking studies focusing on visual communication</li>
	<li>Analysis techniques for eye tracking data to improve visual communication</li>
	<li>General data science applied to eye movement data to analyze visual communications</li>
	<li>Gaze-assisted interaction for visual communication</li>
	<li>HCI and eye tracking</li>
	<li>Eye tracking in virtual and augmented reality</li>

<h3 id="workshop2">Workshop on Immersive Analytics and Visual Communication (IAVC)</h3>
<p>
    Immersive analytics investigates the applicability and development of emerging user-interface technologies for supporting a deep cognitive involvement when understanding and reasoning about data, as well as for creating more engaging experiences for data analysis. It focuses on multi-sensory interfaces for collaboration and for facilitating the immersion of users in their data. 
</p>

<p>
Recent advances in immersive technologies (VR, AR, large displays, tangible surfaces, etc.) create new opportunities to using these technologies to analyse and explore data. Immersive environments are also more and more often used for decision making and for telling stories about data.

</p>

<p>
Designing and evaluating immersive analytics concepts and environments presents many challenges, including the support for collaboration, the design of efficient multimodal interfaces, the use of stereoscopic 3D, the integration of human-centered computational analytics, and the assessment of immersion and its benefit for analysis.
</p>

<p> 
In this workshop we aim to give a perspective on the current state of the art, to investigate current challenges and potential solutions, to identify new research questions, and to explore interesting application use-cases.
</p>

<h4>Relevant topics for this workshop include:</h4>
<div class="items-twocol">
<ul>
    <li>Communicating information using immersive environments, including tools and techniques</li>
    <li>Applications for Immersive Analytics</li>
