            <h3 id="workshop1">Workshop on 3D Interaction for Visual Communication (3DIVC)</h3>
            <p>
                Todayâ€™s visualizations are generally expected to provide some degree of interactivity. Interaction is the key ingredient that enables exploration of otherwise static images and is a driving force for advances in real-time computer graphics as well. The combination of interaction and real-time rendering has fundamentally changed the understanding of visual information communication.
            </p>

            <p>
                For several decades we have become familiar with 2D user interfaces and with it, 2D visualizations and interactions. With recent advances in, e.g., GPUs and touch-based devices, minification of sensors, gaze-tracking, gesture-detection, and many more, we have been introduced to more advanced, yet more complicated, metaphors for 3D interactions (e.g., navigating in 3D cartography or walking immersive VR environments).
            </p>

            <p>
                This allowed for many immersive and powerful applications, but also increased the number of possibilities for and complexity of 3D interactions for visual communication. With a dedicated focus on 3D, this workshop aims to explore state-of-the-art, to investigate current challenges and potential solutions, to identify new research questions, and to give a perspective on interesting use cases.

            <h3 id="workshop2">Workshop on Algorithm Animation and Visual Presentation (AAVP)</h3>
            <p>
                Algorithms play a major role in many research disciplines since they are powerful concepts to transform data into a suitable form to derive patterns, find rules, or compute solutions to well-defined problems. Examples are Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, K-means clustering, or simple sorting algorithms such as merge- or quicksort.
            </p>

            <p>
                In typical cases we are interested in the final outcome of an algorithm, but in some situations an algorithm might produce wrong results or might have runtime issues that are hard or nearly impossible to identify if just the end result can be inspected. A visual presentation is necessary to observe the internal workings of an algorithm to find flaws and bottlenecks easier and faster.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this workshop we will discuss typical problems occuring for the visual presentation of algorithms, starting with the algorithm description and input parameters. The general research question of this topic is to find suitable and efficient ways to explore the internal workings of algorithms, either as an animation or a static representation, in the best case a combination of both concepts.

            <h3 id="workshop3">2nd Workshop on Eye Tracking and Visual Communication (ETVC)</h3>
            <p>
                Eye tracking is a powerful technology to record people's eye movement behavior while they solve a certain task. For example, watching a video, reading or implementing source code, interacting with a user interface, walking in a 3D scene, using VR technologies, or just understanding a static diagram.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although lots of eye tracking experiments have been conducted over the years, it still remains challenging to analyze the recorded spatio-temporal data for common patterns, in particular, if the goal is to explore the common visual communication that is important to improve the provided stimuli, being them static, dynamic, interactive, 2D, or 3D.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this workshop on "Eye Tracking and Visual Communication (ETVC)" we focus on applying eye tracking techniques and eye movement data exploration strategies in order to improve the visual communication between people with and without visual stimuli.

            <h3 id="workshop4">Workshop on Visual Communication in HCI and Design (VCHD)</h3>
            <p>
                Design is an upcoming field in the area of Human Computer Interaction, aiming at the processes, approaches and theory behind designing products, systems and related services. To create these designers and researchers need to make optimal use of the environment and take its intended user into full consideration, the field blends creativity and innovation with technology and societal factors. 
            </p>

            <p>
                To reach this goal, many steps are involved, including interaction design, aesthetics and user studies, but also new opportunities arise for visual communication and visualization of data. In Human-Centered Design users, either laymen or experts, play a major role to create the final product. The communication of the intermediate outputs is of key importance to guide the design process and reach the intended design goals. However, without proper visual tools the communication can be challenging. In addition, live or delayed feedback on device use in practice, provides opportunities for novel ways to conduct user studies, with higher ecological validity. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In this workshop we will discuss relevant problems and challenges that occur in design research focusing on the visual communication in all of the in-between stages. Moreover, we specifically focus on the visual communication that is required to help improve this process.

            <h3 id="workshop5">Workshop on Visual Influence and Influential Visualizations (VIIV)</h3>
            <p>
                A visualization can influence and be influential, defining influence as the quality to change mindsets and behaviors without imposition. Influence of/in visualizations helps to shape ideas, create opinions, spread information or foster debates, often beyond the community of viewers it is devised.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most influential visualizations are recalled, mentioned, or imitated over time; mostly, they generate new knowledge or inspire new visualizations. Although we are all touched by influential visualizations, the topic of influence is still little explored by scholars of visual analysis/communication. For instance, defining, quantifying, and measuring influence in visualizations need to be verified. Equally, thorough investigations are required to define the visual elements that characterize influence or understand how producing more influential visualizations.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this workshop we will discuss ideas, concepts, problems, and challenges around important research questions that focus on influence in visualization and visual communication.
