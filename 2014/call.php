Visual communication through graphical or sign languages has long been conducted among human beings of different backgrounds or cultures, and in recent decades between human and machine. In today's digital world, visual information is typically encoded with various metaphors commonly used in daily life to facilitate rapid comprehension and easy analysis during the communication process. Visual information communication generally encompasses information visualization, graphical user-interfaces, visual analytics, and visual languages. It has been successfully employed in knowledge discovery, end-user programming, modeling, rapid systems prototyping, education, and design activities by people of many disciplines including architects, artists, children, engineers, and scientists. In addition, visual information is increasingly being used to facilitate human-human communication through the Internet and Web technology, and electronic mobile devices.

<h2>
Papers and Posters</h2>
<p>
Authors are invited to submit original and unpublished research and practical 
applications in all areas of visual communication and interaction across a wide 
spectrum of interests and disciplines, including computer science, design, arts, 
sociology, anthropology and psychology. We are particularly interested in work 
that bridges the divide between technology, art and design.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:
</p>

<h3>Area 1: Visualization methodologies</h3>

<p>
Information visualization<br />
Graph drawing and visualization<br />
Cognitive aspects of visual information comprehension<br />
Visual metaphors and symbols<br />
Usability or empirical study of new visual metaphors<br />
Design theory in the digital age<br />
Aesthetics in visual communication and digital media<br />
Interaction methods (touch-based, haptic, vision-based, multi-modality<br />
Big Data<br />
Visual languages<br />
Diagrams<br />
Art + Science<br />
</p>

<h3>Area 2: Visualization applications</h3>

<p>
Visual Analytics<br />
Sketching<br />
Graphical user interface design<br />
Software visualization<br />
Visual approaches to knowledge discovery<br />
Visualization on mobile devices<br />
Animation<br />
Game design<br />
Biological visualizations<br />
</p>

<h3>Area 3: Visual design and art</h3>

<p>
Interaction design<br />
Interactive art<br />
Infographie and data-driven art<br />
Visual perception and cognition<br />
Multimedia<br />
Virtual actors<br />
Interactive storytelling<br />
Augmented reality and its applications<br />
Virtual reality and its applications<br />
Computational (or digital) aesthetics<br />
Wearable computers<br />
Ubiquitous / responsive environments<br />
Entertainment technology</p>
<p>
Papers must be written in English and can be submitted as long papers, short papers and posters.<b> 
</b>All 
accepted papers, including posters, will be published by<b> ACM Press 
</b>and made available in the<b> ACM Digital Library (EI-indexed), 
</b>as has been the case in previous years. 
Further, it has been confirmed that<b> 
</b>a high number of selected papers will be published in 
a special issue of<b>  
</b> <a href="http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/ijseke">International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering</a><b> (IJSEKE, 
SCI indexed) 
</b>and a special issue of<b>

<h2>Workshops and Tutorials</h2>
<p>
VINCI14 is also soliciting proposals for full-day and half-day workshops and 
tutorials on topics that address areas of interest to the community. Workshops 
and tutorials will be held on August 5, 2014. Proposals should be a maximum of 2 
pages and should include:</p>
<p>Outline of the topic <br />A proposed agenda <br />A brief bio of the convenors<br />
A list of any requirements for running the workshop or tutorial, such as access 
to computer labs, data projectors, group work-tables<br /></p>
<p>Proposals, and any related queries, should be sent by email to:
